# Melee-Improover
Melee savestate automation tool
Welcome to Fiction’s Melee Improover! This is a tool that allows players to create savestates of any situation during a live match by simply pressing your designated clip button. You can then use these savestates in Training Mode - Community Edition (TM-CE, formerly known as UnclePunch). The default clip button is D-Pad Down.

READ: This application works best with the latest version of Training Mode - Community Edition (TM-CE) developed by Aitch and UnclePunch. Download the latest version here (it’s free) and join Aitch’s R&D Discord Server linked here to get the latest versions and contribute suggestions, ideas, and bug reports for both TM-CE and Fiction’s Melee Improover! 

DISCLAIMER: Work is still being done to get exported savestates fully functional. If you find something wrong with your savestate, please report it by including your SLP file, and provide the frame number it was exported from. Thank you!

Directions: 
Set Replay and Export Folder paths:
Replay Folder: Where the application will be viewing your games
Alternatively, Drag/Drop games into Melee Improover
Export Folder: Where you send your savestates. This will always be Netplay Dolphin’s Card A Folder (you can learn how to set up this folder by following this tutorial.
 Designate Clip Button:
Games will be automatically filtered by files with savestates only (AKA if your designated input for clipping was pressed). Keep in mind that users can have different clip buttons so the “Savestate Count” column for your opponent may be incorrect. 
Customize Savestate Exports:
Set a Naming Style for exported savestates within TM-CE
You can set the Naming Style to “Game Info” which will list the characters, stage, export number within a replay, and frame the savestate it was exported on. 
You can also double click any cell in the “File Name” column to rename the .slp file itself, which also renames the savestate. Choose “Game + State/Frame Number.” when you do this. If you rename the file while choosing the “Game Info” style, your custom name will remain on the .slp file itself but be overwritten by game info in the savestate itself.  
Change the Clip Length (the default is 360 frames, or around 6 seconds before the button press). Any length you set will be saved for the next session.
Export Savestates:
Select however many files you would like by left-click or left-click + drag, and then right click anywhere in your selection. You can choose to export by Netplay code or by Player. If you are using SLP files with ports 3 or 4 in use, the player columns will be ordered by lowest port to highest port.
Right-click 1 game file to open it in your files or in Slippi
